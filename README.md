A basic GitHub repository example for new [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) projects and those that join the Call for Code with The Linux Foundation deployment initiative. Not all sections or files are required. You can make this as simple or as in-depth as you need.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

We know that the covid ruining the world and it is mandatotry to keep social distancing and people's contact. Our problem is to handle climatic changes during covid situations. Actually there is no solution to handle climatic changes. So we have to  think out of the box for solutions. Meanwhile we are undergoing covid situation, so there is a huge demand for automations during these hard circumstances. so our project will help to overcome these problems. 

### How can technology help?

Now a days, technology plays a crucial role to overcome all tough jobs into simpler one. Technology helps us to do all the activities at home using automation. We can use recent technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, iot and cloud storage to handle this climatic change problem. 
### The idea

Our idea is to produce artificial rain in dry lands to maintain moisture content in lands. We know that during summer we can clearly see the soil crack due to high raise in temperature (global warming).
To overcome that, we use satellites to sense the land using (SAR SENSOR) which detects moisture and sends to ground center and if moisture is less, it sends small missile having cloud seeding chemicals to cloud to produce artificial rain. Then the moisture of soil increases. Here we use satellites to cover larger area to sense. Satellites can be used to send missiles but it is difficult. So,   the ground centers are used because the distance between center and cloud is lesser that the satellite and cloud. 



## Demo video

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

[More detail is available here](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
